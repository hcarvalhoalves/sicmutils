;; ## Calculus of Infinitesimals
;;
;; The idea is that we compute derivatives by passing special
;; "differential objects" [x,dx] through functions. A first approximation to the
;; idea is as follows:
;;
;; f[x,dx] |---> [f(x), Df(x)*dx]
;;
;; Note that the derivative of f at the point x, DF(x), is the coefficient of dx
;; in the result. If we then pass this result through another function, we
;; obtain the chain-rule answer we would hope for.
;;
;; g[f(x), Df(x)*dx] |---> [g(f(x)), DG(f(x))*DF(x)*dx]
;;
;; Thus, we can find the derivative of a composition by this process. We need
;; only define how each of the primitives act on these "differentials" and then
;; we can use ordinary Scheme compositions of these to do the job. See the
;; procedure diff:derivative near the bottom to understand how derivatives are
;; computed given this differential algebra. This idea was discovered by Dan
;; Zuras and Gerald Jay Sussman in 1992. DZ and GJS made the first version of
;; this code during an all nighter in 1992.
;;
;; To expand this idea to work for multiple derivatives of functions of several
;; variables we define an algebra in "infinitesimal space". The objects are
;; multivariate power series in which no incremental has exponent greater than
;; 1. This was worked out in detail by Hal Abelson around 1994, and painfully
;; redone in 1997 by Sussman with the help of Hardy Mayer and Jack Wisdom.
;;
;; A rare and surprising bug was discovered by Alexey Radul in 2011. This was
;; fixed by remapping the infinitesimals for derivatives of functions that
;; returned functions. This was done kludgerously, but it works.
;;
;; ### Data Structures
;;
;; A differential quantity is a typed list of differential terms, representing
;; the power series alluded to earlier. The terms are kept in a sorted order, in
;; ascending order. (Order is the number of incrementals. So dx*dy is higher
;; order than dx or dy.)

;; A differential term is implemented as a pair whose first element is a set of
;; tags and whose second is the coefficient. Let's do the tag set implementation
;; first.

(def ^:private tags first)
(def ^:private coefficient second)

(defn- make-term
  ([coef] [uv/empty-set coef])
  ([tags coef] [tags coef]))

;; Each differential term has a list of tags. The tags represent the
;; incrementals. Roughly, "dx" and "dy" are tags in the terms: 3*dx, 4*dy,
;; 2*dx*dy. There is a tag created for each derivative that is in progress.
;; Since the only use of a tag is to distinguish unnamed incrementals we use
;; positive integers for the tags.

(let [next-tag (atom 0)]
  (defn fresh-tag []
    (swap! next-tag inc)))

;; Tags are small integers. Tag sets are typically of small cardinality. So we
;; experiment with implementing them as small vectors, instead of sorted sets.
;; This implementation lives in [[sicmutils.util.vector-set]], and we use it
;; here.

;; ## Term List Algebra
;;
;; Now, we get to 'terms'. TODO note what is going on... we've multiplied out a
;; bunch of these things, but we can always turn them back into a dual number.
;;
;; From scmutils: "Differential term lists represent a kind of power series, so
;; they can be added and multiplied. It is important to note that when terms are
;; multiplied, no contribution is made if the terms being multiplied have a
;; differential tag in common. Thus dx^2 = zero."
;;
;; TODO also note that Clojure vectors already compare properly, so term lists
;; can be compared nicely now if we compare by just the first terms, not the
;; coefs.... maybe this doesn't matter.

;; ## IPerturbed Protocol, Containers
;;
;; The [[IPerturbed]] protocol allows the user to treat other objects that
;; aren't specifically [[Differential]] instances as if they were
;; 'differential'. The docstrings tell some of the story:

(defprotocol IPerturbed
  (perturbed? [this]
    "Returns true if the supplied object has some non-zero tangent to be
    extracted via [[extract-tangent]], false otherwise. (Return `false` by
    default if you can't detect a perturbation.)")

  (replace-tag [this old-tag new-tag]
    "If the supplied object `this` is perturbed, Returns a similar object with
    the the perturbation modified by replacing any perturbation tagged with
    `old-tag` with the `new-tag`. Else, acts as identity.")

  (extract-tangent [this tag]
    "If the supplied object `this` is perturbed, return the tangent component
    paired with the supplied tag. Else, returns `([[sicmutils.value/zero-like]]
    this)`."))

;; The [[IPerturbed]] protocol exists for two reasons:
;;
;; 1. Any function that takes a [[Differential]] can stuff that differential
;;    into a container, or wrap it inside of a function (any 'functor',
;;    technically); we have to be able to `fmap` into the structure and extract
;;    the tangent components from the [[Differential]] instances.

;; 2. The way that [[Differential]] instances interact with container types in
;;    sicmutils makes it easy for these captures to occur all over. Whenever we
;;    multiply a [[Differential]] by a structure, a function, a vector, any of
;;    those things, our implementation of the sicmutils generics pushes
;;    the [[Differential]] inside those objects, rather than forming
;;    a [[Differential]] with, for example, some structure in the primal and
;;    tangent parts.
;;
;; NOTE: [[perturbed?]] is (as of version 0.14.0) only used
;; by [[sicmutils.abstract.function]] to detect if the caller is attempting to
;; take its derivative. In the original scmutils, this check is
;; actually [[differential?]], vs checking for containers. I think that our
;; implementation is more correct.

;;

;; functions.

  - some unary function `f`
  - a function `df:dx` that computes the derivative of `f` with respect to its
    single argument

  Returns a new unary function that operates on both the original type of `f`
  and [[Differential]] instances.

  NOTE: With the current implementation, `f` has to ALREADY be able to
  handle [[Differential]] instances. This is accomplished today because the
  function returned by `lift-1` is installed into the generic arithmetic system
  as, say, `g/exp`, and `g/exp` is passed as the argument.

  As an example, if the [[primal-part]] of `x` is still a [[Differential]], `f`
  is going to receive a [[Differential]], and must already be lifted too."

  Returns a new binary function that operates on both the original type of `f`
